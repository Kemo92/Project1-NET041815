# Project1-NET041815
The first problem set for students in NET041815. The following exercises are extremely basic, but you will be asked to present your solutions as part of your weekly progress presentations. You are also expeced to have your GitHub account fully functional, and use your account to fork this repo. All answers should be pushed to a directory called `FirstnameLastname` in your version of this repository.

###Basic Flow-Control Exercises

-------------

**Exercise CheckPassFail** (if-else): Write a program called `CheckPassFail` which prints "PASS" if the `int` variable `mark` is more than or equal to 50; or prints "FAIL" otherwise.

**Exercise PrintNumberInWord** (nested-if, switch-case): Write a program called `PrintNumberInWord` which prints "ONE", "TWO",... , "NINE", "OTHER" if the `int` variable `number` is 1, 2,... , 9, or other, respectively. Use (a) a "nested-if" statement; (b) a "switch-case" statement.

--------------

###Loop Exercises

**Exercise SumAndAverage** (Loop): Write a program called `SumAndAverage` to produce the sum of 1, 2, 3, ..., to an upperbound (e.g., 100). Also compute and display the average. The output shall look like:
`The sum is 5050`
`The average is 50.5`
TRY:
1. Modify the program to use a "while" loop instead of "for" loop.
2. Modify the program to sum from 111 to 8899, and compute the average. Introduce an `int` variable called `count` to count the numbers in the specified range.
3. Modify the program to sum only the odd numbers from 1 to 100, and compute the average. (Hint: `n` is an odd number if `n % 2` is not `0`.)
4. Modify the program to sum those numbers from 1 to 100 that is divisible by 7, and compute the average.
5. Modify the program to find the "sum of the squares" of all the numbers from 1 to 100, i.e. 1*1 + 2*2 + 3*3 + ... + 100*100.

**Exercise CozaLozaWoza** (Loop & Condition): Write a program called `CozaLozaWoza` which prints the numbers 1 to 110, 11 numbers per line. The program shall print "Coza" in place of the numbers which are multiples of 3, "Loza" for multiples of 5, "Woza" for multiples of 7, "CozaLoza" for multiples of 3 and 5, and so on. The output shall look like:
```
1 2 Coza 4 Loza Coza Woza 8 Coza Loza 11 
Coza 13 Woza CozaLoza 16 17 Coza 19 Loza CozaWoza 22 
23 Coza Loza 26 Coza Woza 29 CozaLoza 31 32 Coza
```
